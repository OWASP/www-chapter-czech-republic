Our CFP (Call For Papers) is always open. We would love to offer you an opportunity to speak at our local Czech Republic chapter meetings. Do you have any interesting topics to talk about? Don't hesitate to send the description of your talk to our [official Twitter account](https://twitter.com/owasp_czech) (DM) or by email to any Czech Chapter Leaders (email addresses above), and we will get back to you.

OWASP beers
-----------
In past years we have organized many chapter meetings and created a great community around Czech OWASP. We were looking for ways to make it possible for you to meet more often than four times per year. That is why we came up with the idea of OWASP Beers! This event happens every last Thursday of the month. It happens in Radegastovna Perón, Praha 5 around 7 PM.

There are no talks, but you can talk to similarly-minded people who also love IT security.

No registration is required, but we would appreciate you sending DM to our Twitter account so we know how many seats we should reserve.

-----------
We would like to kindly thank the following companies for supporting us:
* [NN](https://www.nn.cz/)
* [Kiwi.com](https://code.kiwi.com/)
* [Livesport.eu](https://www.livesport.eu/)

As we want to keep the pace of 4 events a year, often with [top-notch foreign speakers](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/owasp-czech-chapter-meeting-registration-74841933237), we're always looking for new sponsors. If you want to discuss details, please get in touch with us via the official emails above.
