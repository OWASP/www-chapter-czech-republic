OWASP beers
-----------
In past years we have organized many chapter meetings and created a great community around Czech OWASP. We were looking for a ways how to make it possible for you to meet more often than four times per year. That is why we came up with the idea of OWASP Beers! This event happens every last Thursday in month. It happens in Radegastovna Perón, Praha 5 around 7 PM.

There are no talks, but you will have a chance to talk to similarly minded people who also love IT security.

No registration is needed to attend but we would appreciate you sensing DM to our Twitter account so we know how many seats we should make a reservation for.
